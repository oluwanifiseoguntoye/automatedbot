# Automated Email Shift Pick ups using Selenium & Gmail API
I made an automated bot that watches over my work email and picks up shifts for me depending on if it fits my availability

## A bit of background

<p>
  I am a computer science and Mathematics tutor for:

  Since the 2023 New Year, there's been a shift shortage where even tutors submit up to 40 hours of availability in a week,
  they'd get the bare minimum, 4 hours. This has been going on all year and really impacted me, personally, as this is my sole income as a Student in Toronto. Until
  September, when I decided I was going to do something about it.

## Email Transfers

<p>
  Scheduled shifts <strong>aren't</strong> the only way to get hours in the week. We also have Shift Transfer Requests that come as emails which look like

<p>
  These are scheduled shifts other tutors don't want so they request to have them transferred. With so many tutors underemployed, these transfer requests disappear within the minute. I could never really get too many of them because they come at random times and I would need to go into the email, click on the button, log into my account for the shift. It took too long and it was way too stressful. So I decided to make a bot that would do all of that for me.

## Results
<p>
  I made this bot back in September when school started because I couldn't afford to 1) Not get any shits and 2) Spend too much time watching my email. The automated bot is constantly running on my laptop needing no manual intervention to pick up shifts. It's been largely successful and I managed to pick up all the shift transfers that fit my availabilityâ€” going from 4 hours to 20-30 weekly.
